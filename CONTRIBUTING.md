### Key Architecture Features

**Sharded Question Bank** - Questions are split by topic to reduce context usage by 70-80%:
- `questions/index.yaml` - Topic list with metadata
- `questions/{topic-id}.md` - Individual topic files
- Topics loaded on-demand during interviews

**Technology Registry** - All technologies listed in `technologies/supported-technologies.yaml` with:
- ID, name, icon, status (active/coming_soon)
- Topic list and question count
- Experience levels supported

## Adding a New Technology

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure

```bash
technologies/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {tech-id}/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ competency-matrix.yaml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ questions/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.yaml
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {topic-id}.md  (one per topic)
```

**Technology ID naming convention:**
- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens for multi-word names
- Examples: `csharp`, `python`, `frontend-react`, `backend-java`

### Step 2: Create `config.yaml`

Use `technologies/csharp/config.yaml` as reference:

```yaml
technology:
  id: your-tech-id
  name: "Technology Display Name"
  icon: "üî∑"
  version: 1.0.0

  description: |
    Brief technology description and scope

  topics:
    - Topic Name 1
    - Topic Name 2
    # 8-12 topics recommended

  frameworks:
    - name: Framework Name
      versions: [version1, version2]

  key_concepts:
    category1:
      - Concept 1
      - Concept 2

  # Path to competency matrix file
  competency_matrix_path: technologies/your-tech-id/competency-matrix.yaml
  competency_matrix_description: |
    Competency matrix defining expectations for each experience level.
    Includes must_know, good_to_know, evaluation criteria, and scoring.

  # Path to question bank
  question_bank_path: technologies/your-tech-id/questions/
  question_bank_structure: sharded
  question_bank_description: |
    Topic-based sharded question repository for efficient context usage.
    Each topic is stored in a separate markdown file and loaded on-demand.
    Start by loading questions/index.yaml, then load individual topic files as needed.

# Metadata section
metadata:
  last_updated: 2025-10-19
  version: 1.0.0

```

### Step 3: Create `competency-matrix.yaml`

Define skill progression across experience levels. See `technologies/csharp/competency-matrix.yaml` for reference.

### Step 4: Create `questions/index.yaml`

```yaml
metadata:
  technology: Technology Name
  technology_id: your-tech-id
  version: 1.0.0
  question_format: markdown
  total_topics: 10
  last_updated: 2025-10-19

topics:
  - id: topic-id
    name: Topic Display Name
    file: topic-id.md
    description: Topic scope
    estimated_questions: 15
    weight: 1.2  # Importance multiplier (0.8-1.5)
```

**Weight Guidelines:**
- `1.3-1.5` - Critical topics (fundamental concepts, core skills)
- `1.0-1.2` - Important topics (commonly used features)
- `0.8-0.9` - Supplementary topics (less common but useful)

### Step 5: Create Question Files

Create `questions/{topic-id}.md` for each topic:

```markdown
# Topic Name
<!-- File: interview-agent/technologies/{tech-id}/questions/{topic-id}.md -->

## Topic Overview
Brief description of topic scope.

**Weight**: 1.2 (Importance level)

---

## Questions

### Question Title?
Concise answer covering key points.

### More Complex Question?
**Key Points:**
- Point 1
- Point 2

**Common Mistakes:**
- Mistake to avoid

**When to Use:**
- Use case scenario

---
```

**Question Guidelines:**
- Keep answers concise but complete
- Focus on practical knowledge
- Include common mistakes where relevant
- Use bullet points for clarity
- 10-20 questions per topic file
- Mix difficulty levels within topics

### Step 6: Update Technology Registry

Add your technology to `technologies/supported-technologies.yaml`:

```yaml
technologies:
  - id: your-tech-id
    name: "Technology Name"
    icon: "üî∑"
    status: active
    description: Brief description
    topics:
      - Topic 1
      - Topic 2
    experience_levels:
      - fresher
      - junior
      - mid-level
      - senior
      - architect
    question_count: 150
```

Update metadata:
```yaml
metadata:
  last_updated: "2025-10-19"
  total_technologies: 4  # Increment
  active_technologies: 2  # Increment if active
  total_questions: 350    # Add your question count
```

- Consistent bullet list style

## Testing Your Changes

### 1. Validate YAML Syntax

```bash
# Python with PyYAML
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('technologies/your-tech/config.yaml'))"

# Or use online validators like yamllint.com
```

### 2. Check File Structure

```bash
# Verify all referenced files exist
ls technologies/your-tech/questions/index.yaml
ls technologies/your-tech/questions/*.md
```

### 3. Verify Question Counts

Ensure `estimated_questions` in `questions/index.yaml` matches actual questions in topic files.

### 4. Test with Custom GPT (Optional)

1. Fork repository and push changes
2. Update `openapi-schema.yaml` server URL to your fork
3. Configure test Custom GPT
4. Test interview flow with new technology

### 5. Verify Links

- Check all resource URLs are accessible
