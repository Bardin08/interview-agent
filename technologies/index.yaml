description: Technology resources including registry, configurations, questions, and competency matrices

files:
  - name: supported-technologies.yaml
    description: Technology registry with metadata for all supported technologies (IDs, names, icons, status)

structure:
  per_technology:
    - config.yaml
    - competency-matrix.yaml
    - questions/
        index.yaml (topic list and loading strategy)
        {topic-id}.md (individual topic questions)

question_bank_architecture:
  format: sharded (topic-based)
  benefits:
    - Reduces context usage by 70-80%
    - Enables support for more technologies simultaneously
    - Faster question selection with focused topic pools
    - On-demand loading based on interview focus

  loading_pattern:
    - Load questions/index.yaml first to get topic list
    - Load 1-3 topic files at a time during interview
    - Unload completed topics to free context space
