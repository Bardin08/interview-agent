## C# Language Fundamentals

### What is C# and how does it differ from C?
- C# is object-oriented
- Supports automatic garbage collection
- Requires .NET framework
- More type-safe compared to C

### Strong-typing vs Weak-typing
Understanding type safety and type systems in programming languages.

### What does the "readonly" keyword mean?
Fields that can only be assigned during declaration or in constructor.

### What does the "volatile" keyword mean?
Indicates that a field might be modified by multiple threads concurrently.

### Explain "ref" and "out" parameters
- **ref**: Passes argument by reference, must be initialized before passing
- **out**: Passes argument by reference, must be assigned within the method

### Difference between override vs new
- **override**: Overrides base class virtual method
- **new**: Hides base class method

### Explain virtual, sealed, override, and abstract keywords
- **virtual**: Allows method to be overridden
- **sealed**: Prevents inheritance or overriding
- **override**: Provides new implementation of virtual method
- **abstract**: Defines method signature without implementation

### What are short-circuited operators?
Logical operators (&& and ||) that stop evaluation once result is determined.

### Access Modifiers
- **public**: Accessible from anywhere
- **protected**: Accessible within class and derived classes
- **private**: Accessible only within the class
- **internal**: Accessible within same assembly

### Difference between typeof(foo) and myFoo.GetType()
- **typeof()**: Compile-time type evaluation
- **GetType()**: Runtime type evaluation

---

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### What is Inheritance?
Inheritance represents the relationship between two classes where one type derives functionality from a second type and extends it by adding new methods, properties, events, fields, and constants.

### Does C# support multiple inheritance?
- C# doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes
- Can use interfaces to inherit properties from multiple sources
- Supports single inheritance

### What's the difference between an abstract class and interface?
Key differences in implementation, multiple inheritance support, and use cases.

### Interface-oriented vs Object-oriented vs Aspect-oriented programming
Different programming paradigms and their applications.

### What are Events and Delegates?
- **Event**: A message sent by a control to notify the occurrence of an action
- **Delegate**: A type-safe function pointer that acts as an intermediary between sender and receiver objects
- Delegates allow passing methods of one class to objects of other classes

### What are Extension Methods?
- Add new methods to existing classes
- Static methods
- Can extend functionality without modifying original class

### What is Reflection?
The ability to find information about types contained in an assembly at runtime. Allows inspecting objects and application details at run-time.

### Use of Reflection
- Detect class attributes
- Inspect metadata
- Dynamically invoke methods
- Load assemblies at runtime

### What are Partial Classes?
Classes split across multiple files, allowing separation of auto-generated and custom code.

---

## Memory Management & Performance

### What is Garbage Collection?
Garbage collector automatically manages memory by:
- Allocating memory for objects
- Identifying and reclaiming memory from unused objects
- Organizing objects into three generations (0, 1, 2) based on their lifecycle

### How does .NET's generational garbage collector work?
Three generations:
- **Generation 0**: Short-lived objects
- **Generation 1**: Mid-lifetime objects
- **Generation 2**: Long-lived objects

### Difference between Finalize() and Dispose()
- **Finalize()**: Called by garbage collector, non-deterministic
- **Dispose()**: Manually called to release resources, deterministic

### What's a WeakReference?
A reference that doesn't prevent the garbage collector from reclaiming the object.

### Difference between value-type and reference-type
- **Value types**: Stored on stack, contains actual data
- **Reference types**: Stored on heap, contains reference to data

### Boxing and Unboxing
- **Boxing**: Converting value type to reference type (object)
- **Unboxing**: Converting reference type back to value type
- Performance overhead consideration

### What is a PID (Process ID)?
Unique identifier for a running process in the operating system.

### Describe the difference between a Thread and a Process
- **Process**: Independent execution environment with own memory space
- **Thread**: Lightweight execution unit within a process, shares memory

### Maximum memory for a single Windows process
Depends on architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit) and OS version.

---

## Collections & Data Structures

### What is an Array?
A collection of related instances (either value or reference types). C# supports single, multi-dimensional, and jagged arrays.

### Array vs ArrayList
- **Arrays**: Fixed size, type-safe, System.Array namespace
- **ArrayList**: Dynamic size, can contain mixed data types, System.Collections namespace

### What are Generics?
- Allow type-safe code reuse
- Defined inside angular brackets <>
- Reduce boxing/unboxing overhead
- Enable creating type-safe collections

### String vs StringBuilder
- **String**: Immutable, creates new object on modification
- **StringBuilder**: Mutable, efficient for multiple string manipulations

### Properties and Indexers
Enable controlled access to class members and collection-like access patterns.

---

## Threading & Concurrency

### What is a lock statement in C#?
Ensures that one thread does not enter a critical section of code while another thread is in the critical section.

### What is the use of Monitor in C#?
Provides a mechanism that synchronizes access to objects. Controls access by granting a lock for an object to a single thread.

### How to create a critical section with lock()
Use lock statement to ensure thread-safe access to shared resources.

### How many processes can listen on a single TCP/IP port?
Only one process can listen on a specific port at a time (per IP address).

### How does a browser form POST become a server-side event?
ASP.NET event model translates HTTP POST into server-side event handlers.

### HTTP Verbs: GET and POST
- **GET**: Retrieve data, parameters in URL, idempotent
- **POST**: Submit data, parameters in body, not idempotent

### HTTP Status Codes
- 2xx: Success
- 3xx: Redirection
- 4xx: Client errors
- 5xx: Server errors

### Master Pages
- Template for consistent page layout across website
- Uses ContentPlaceHolder control to define customizable regions
- Changes in master page reflect across all content pages

### Navigation Methods

**ForEach loop:**
```csharp
foreach (DataRow row in dTable.Rows)
{
    yourvariable = row["ColumnName"].ToString();
}
```

Avoid naming conflicts and organize XML elements.

### When to use DOM (Document Object Model)
When need to navigate, modify, or perform multiple operations on XML document.

### Difference between Well-Formed and Valid XML
- **Well-Formed**: Follows XML syntax rules
- **Valid**: Follows XML syntax AND conforms to a schema (DTD/XSD)

### XML validation in .NET
Using XmlReader, XmlDocument with schemas, or LINQ to XML.

### Difference between XPathDocument and XmlDocument

## Advanced Topics

### What is a static constructor?
Used to initialize static data members as soon as the class is referenced first time. A static constructor does not take access modifiers or have parameters.

### What is a Windows Service?
Background application that runs without user interface, typically starts with OS.

### Difference between static and non-static methods
- **Static methods**: Belong to class, called without instance
- **Non-static methods**: Belong to instance, require object

### Method Overloading
Multiple methods with same name but different parameters.

### Can DateTimes be null?
DateTime is a value type and cannot be null. Use Nullable<DateTime> or DateTime? for nullable dates.

### Issues with DateTime.Parse(myString)
- Culture-specific parsing
- Can throw exceptions
- Ambiguous date formats
- Prefer DateTime.TryParse() or DateTime.ParseExact()

### What is cyclomatic complexity?
Metric measuring the number of independent paths through code, indicating complexity.

### Contrast OOP and SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)
Different architectural approaches to software design.

### Why is catch(Exception) almost always bad?
- Too broad, catches everything including system exceptions
- Hides bugs
- Makes debugging difficult
- Better to catch specific exceptions

### Create a custom event handler
Implementing custom events using delegates and event keyword.
