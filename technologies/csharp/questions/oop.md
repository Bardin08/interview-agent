## Questions

### What is Inheritance?
Inheritance represents the relationship between two classes where one type derives functionality from a second type and extends it by adding new methods, properties, events, fields, and constants.

### Does C# support multiple inheritance?
- C# doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes
- Can use interfaces to inherit properties from multiple sources
- Supports single inheritance

### What's the difference between an abstract class and interface?
Key differences in implementation, multiple inheritance support, and use cases.

### Interface-oriented vs Object-oriented vs Aspect-oriented programming
Different programming paradigms and their applications.

### What are Events and Delegates?
- **Event**: A message sent by a control to notify the occurrence of an action
- **Delegate**: A type-safe function pointer that acts as an intermediary between sender and receiver objects
- Delegates allow passing methods of one class to objects of other classes

### What are Extension Methods?
- Add new methods to existing classes
- Static methods
- Can extend functionality without modifying original class

### What is Reflection?
The ability to find information about types contained in an assembly at runtime. Allows inspecting objects and application details at run-time.

### Use of Reflection
- Detect class attributes
- Inspect metadata
- Dynamically invoke methods
- Load assemblies at runtime

### What are Partial Classes?
Classes split across multiple files, allowing separation of auto-generated and custom code.
