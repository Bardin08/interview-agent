## Adding a New Technology

### 1. Check Available Technologies

First, check `technologies.json` to see if your technology is already listed as "coming_soon".

### 2. Create Technology Directory Structure

```bash
technologies/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {tech-id}/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml       # Technology configuration
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ questions.md      # Interview questions
```

**Technology ID naming convention:**
- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens for multi-word names
- Examples: `csharp`, `python`, `frontend-react`, `backend-java`

### 3. Create `config.yaml`

Use `technologies/csharp/config.yaml` as a template. Your config should include:

```yaml
technology:
  id: your-tech-id
  name: "Technology Display Name"
  icon: "üî∑"  # Pick an appropriate emoji
  description: Brief technology description

topics:
  - Topic Category 1
  - Topic Category 2
  # 8-12 topics recommended

frameworks:
  - name: Framework Name
    description: Brief description
    versions: [version1, version2]

    question_count: 20-25
    focus_topics: [System Design, Best Practices, Architecture]
```

### 4. Create `questions.md`

Organize questions by topics defined in your config:

```markdown
# {Technology Name} Interview Questions

## Topic Category 1

### Question Title?

**Difficulty:** Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced
**Experience Level:** Fresher|Junior|Mid-Level|Senior|Architect

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Important concept 1
- Important concept 2
- Important concept 3

**Expected Answer:**
Detailed explanation of what a good answer should include...

**Common Mistakes:**
- Mistake candidates often make
- Another common mistake

**Follow-up Questions:**
- Related question 1?
- Related question 2?

---

### Next Question?

[Repeat format...]

## Topic Category 2

[More questions...]
```

**Question Guidelines:**
- Aim for 150-250 questions total
- Distribute across all experience levels
- Include a mix of theoretical and practical questions
- Add real-world scenarios and code examples where applicable
- Mark difficulty and target experience level clearly

### 5. Update `technologies.json`

Add your technology to the registry:

```json
{
  "id": "your-tech-id",
  "name": "Technology Name",
  "icon": "üî∑",
  "status": "active",
  "description": "Brief technology description",
  "topics": [
    "Topic 1",
    "Topic 2"
  ],
  "experience_levels": [
    "fresher",
    "junior",
    "mid-level",
    "senior",
    "architect"
  ],
  "question_count": 200
}
```

Update metadata:
```json
"metadata": {
  "last_updated": "2025-10-17",
  "total_technologies": 6,
  "active_technologies": 2,
  "total_questions": 400
}
```

### 6. Update OpenAPI Schema (Optional)

If your technology ID differs from standard patterns, add it to the enum in `openapi-schema.yaml`:

```yaml
schema:
  type: string
  enum: [csharp, python, javascript, your-tech-id]
```

# If you have Python/PyYAML installed
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('technologies/your-tech/config.yaml'))"

# Or use online YAML validators
```

### 2. Validate JSON Files

```bash
# Use jq if available
jq empty technologies.json

# Or use online JSON validators
```

### 3. Check OpenAPI Schema

Use the ChatGPT Custom GPT Actions editor to validate the schema:
1. Copy `openapi-schema.yaml` content
2. Paste into ChatGPT Actions schema editor
3. Click "Format" to check for errors

### 4. Test with Custom GPT

1. Update your fork on GitHub
2. Update the server URL in `openapi-schema.yaml` to point to your fork
3. Configure a test Custom GPT with your schema
4. Test the interview flow with your new technology

### 5. Verify Links

- Check that all resource URLs are accessible
- Ensure documentation links are current
- Verify course/book links are valid
